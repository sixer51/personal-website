<!-- #### About me -->
I am a Mechanical Engineering PhD candidate at Tufts University advised by Prof. [Markus P. Nemitz](https://engineering.tufts.edu/me/people/faculty/markus-nemitz).

<!-- [Robotic Materials Group](https://wp.wpi.edu/roboticmaterialsgroup/) at Worcester Polytechnic institute advised by Prof. [Markus P. Nemitz](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/mnemitz). -->

My research interest lies in the intersection of additive manufacturing and soft robots.

<!-- , and underwater robotics. My current research focuses on how to improve 3D printing techniques to create functional watertight components for underwater robots. -->

I received my Master's degree in Computer Science at Dartmouth College, under the supervision of Prof. [Devin Balkcom](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/devin/) and Prof. [Alberto Quattrini Li](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/albertoq/) and Bachelor's degree in Automation, focusing on Mechatronics, at Beihang University.
