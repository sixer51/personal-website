In this project, we developed a robot to inspect highway trash status. Whenever it detects a trash with the camera, position and estimated trash category can be sent to responsible staff for cleaning. The robot can move along the edge of highway by following the edge white line to avoid influencing the traffic.

We won the First Prize in National Competition of Transport Science and Technology for Students in 2018.

I was responsible for the mechatronics design of the robot.
